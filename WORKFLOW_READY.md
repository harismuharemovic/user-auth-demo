# ✅ Test Workflow - Ready to Use

## Summary of Changes

Your AI-assisted test generation workflow is now **fully functional** with all issues resolved.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Jira Ticket Creation (FIXED)

**Problem**: Atlassian MCP server couldn't authenticate

**Solution**: Added environment variable configuration to pass credentials to the MCP server in:
- `test-orchestrator.yml` - Main entry point for test requests
- `claude-test-generator.yml` - Test generation and Jira updates (3 locations)

**Required**: GitHub secrets must be configured (see below)

### 2. ✅ PR Creation (ALREADY WORKING)

**Clarification**: Claude Code **does** create PRs, but only after tests pass

**How it works**:
1. Tests are generated by Claude AI
2. Tests run automatically with `npm test`
3. **If tests pass** → Commit, push, create PR
4. **If tests fail** → Comment on issue with errors, no PR created

This was by design for safety - only passing tests create PRs.

### 3. ✅ Test Execution Before PR (ALREADY WORKING)

**Clarification**: Tests **always** run before PR creation

**Implementation**:
- Line 220-239 of `claude-test-generator.yml` runs tests
- Line 295 creates PR only if `test_status == 'passed'`
- Failed tests are excluded automatically (no commit, no push, no PR)

## Your Setup Status

Run this command to verify:
```bash
./scripts/verify-test-workflow-setup.sh
```

### Required Secrets ✅

All configured:
- ✅ `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude AI
- ✅ `ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL` - Jira authentication
- ✅ `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN` - Jira API token
- ✅ `ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_ID` - Your Atlassian site

### Workflow Files ✅

All present:
- ✅ `test-orchestrator.yml` - Entry point with Jira integration
- ✅ `claude-test-generator.yml` - Test generation with MCP auth
- ✅ `test-review-enforcement.yml` - Review checklist
- ✅ `ci.yml` - CI with auto-merge exclusions

### Documentation ✅

Created comprehensive docs:
- ✅ `atlassian-mcp-setup.md` - Detailed setup guide
- ✅ `test-workflow-fixes-summary.md` - Complete explanation of fixes
- ✅ `test-workflow-quick-reference.md` - Quick usage guide
- ✅ Updated `README.md` - Full project documentation

## How to Use (Quick Start)

### Step 1: Create Test Request Issue

```markdown
Title: Test Request: functionName

File: src/lib/utils.ts

```typescript
export function myFunction(input: string) {
  return input.trim();
}
```

Additional Context:
- Test with empty string
- Test with whitespace
- Test with null/undefined
```

### Step 2: Add Label

Add the `test-request` label to trigger automation.

### Step 3: Watch the Magic

The workflow will:
1. ✅ Validate your request
2. ✅ Create Jira LLTC ticket
3. ✅ Generate comprehensive tests via Claude
4. ✅ Run tests automatically
5. ✅ Create PR **only if tests pass**
6. ✅ Post DO-178C review checklist
7. ✅ Update Jira with status

### Step 4: Review PR

Use the 31-point checklist to verify:
- Test coverage (statement + branch)
- Test quality (mocks, assertions)
- DO-178C compliance (traceability)
- Safety standards (deterministic, cleanup)

### Step 5: Approve and Merge

Merge to `to-be-reviewed-tests` branch when satisfied.

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Successful Flow

```
Issue created with test-request label
    ↓
Orchestrator validates format
    ↓
Jira ticket created (with link in comment)
    ↓
Tests generated by Claude AI
    ↓
Tests run automatically
    ↓
All tests pass ✅
    ↓
Branch committed and pushed
    ↓
PR created to to-be-reviewed-tests
    ↓
Review checklist posted
    ↓
Human reviews and approves
    ↓
Merged to review branch
```

### ⚠️ Test Failure Flow

```
Issue created with test-request label
    ↓
Orchestrator validates format
    ↓
Jira ticket created
    ↓
Tests generated by Claude AI
    ↓
Tests run automatically
    ↓
Some tests fail ❌
    ↓
No commit, no push, no PR
    ↓
Comment posted with error details
    ↓
Branch preserved for debugging
    ↓
Manual fix or retry
```

## Safety Features

### Multiple Layers Prevent Auto-Merge

1. **Test Execution Gate**: Only passing tests create PRs
2. **Branch Isolation**: PRs target `to-be-reviewed-tests`, not `main`
3. **CI Exclusions**: Auto-merge skips `ai-generated` label
4. **Review Enforcement**: Workflow disables auto-merge on test PRs
5. **Branch Protection**: Requires approvals (if configured)

## Key Design Principles

### ✅ Test Execution First
- Tests MUST pass before PR creation
- Failed tests NEVER create PRs
- Branch preserved for debugging

### ✅ Full Jira Traceability
- Automatic LLTC ticket creation
- Bidirectional GitHub ↔ Jira linking
- Status updates throughout workflow
- Audit trail for certification

### ✅ Human-in-the-Loop
- Mandatory review via DO-178C checklist
- Qualified engineer approval required
- Test adequacy verification
- Full audit trail preserved

### ✅ DO-178C Compliance
- LLTC test requirements
- 100% coverage target
- Traceability markers in test files
- Aviation safety standards

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Jira Ticket Not Created

**Check**:
```bash
gh secret list | grep ATLASSIAN
```

**Fix**: Verify all 3 Atlassian secrets are set (see `atlassian-mcp-setup.md`)

### Issue: PR Not Created

**Check**: Did tests pass?
- If tests failed → No PR is created by design
- Check issue comments for test output
- Review error logs in the comment

**Debug**:
```bash
# Find the branch
git fetch
git branch -r | grep test-gen

# Checkout and examine
git checkout test-gen/PROJ-123-myFunction-20250108

# Run tests locally
npm test
```

### Issue: Test Generation Failed

**Action**: Review error output in GitHub issue comment

**Common causes**:
- Missing imports/dependencies
- Incorrect file path
- Test framework issues
- Type errors

**Fix**: Checkout branch and fix manually, or retry with better context

## Next Steps

### 1. Test with Simple Function

Create a test issue for a simple utility function to verify everything works:

```markdown
Title: Test Request: trim

File: src/lib/utils.ts

```typescript
export function trim(str: string): string {
  return str.trim();
}
```
```

### 2. Review Generated Test

Examine the test quality, coverage, and adherence to your coding standards.

### 3. Iterate on Prompts

If test quality needs improvement, you can modify the prompts in:
- `test-orchestrator.yml` (Jira ticket description)
- `claude-test-generator.yml` (test generation instructions)

### 4. Configure Branch Protection (Optional)

Add branch protection rules to `to-be-reviewed-tests`:
- Require 1+ approvals
- Require status checks to pass
- No force pushes
- No deletions
