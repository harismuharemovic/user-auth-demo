# Test Generation Workflow - Setup Guide

## Initial Configuration

### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Jira/Atlassian account and project
- Anthropic API key (for Claude)
- Admin access to repository

---

## Step 1: GitHub Secrets Configuration

### Required Secrets

Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions** ‚Üí **New repository secret**

#### 1. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```
Name: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
Value: sk-ant-api03-xxx...
```
Get from: https://console.anthropic.com/

#### 2. GitHub Token (Automatic)
`GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically provided by GitHub Actions. No action needed.

### Optional Secrets

#### JIRA_PROJECT_KEY
```
Name: JIRA_PROJECT_KEY
Value: PROJ
```
Your default Jira project key for test tickets.

---

## Step 2: Atlassian/Jira Configuration

### Option A: Environment Variables (Recommended for Local Testing)

Create `.env` file in repository root:
```env
ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_ID=your-site.atlassian.net
ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
ATLASSIAN_EMAIL=your-email@company.com
```

**Get API Token:**
1. Go to: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Name it "Test Generation Workflow"
4. Copy token to `.env`

### Option B: GitHub Actions Environment

For CI/CD, credentials are handled via MCP server at runtime.

### Jira Project Setup

1. **Create or use existing project** for test tickets
2. **Verify issue type** "Task" exists (or create custom "Test Task")
3. **Create custom labels** (optional):
   - `ai-generated-test`
   - `lltc`
   - `requires-review`
4. **Note your project key** (e.g., "PROJ", "TEST")

---

## Step 3: Branch Configuration

### Create Protected Branches

The `to-be-reviewed-tests` branch has been created. Now configure protection:

1. **Navigate to**: Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add branch protection rule

2. **Branch name pattern**: `to-be-reviewed-tests`

3. **Protection settings**:
   ```
   ‚òë Require a pull request before merging
     ‚òë Require approvals: 1
     ‚òë Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   ‚òë Require status checks to pass before merging
     ‚òë Require branches to be up to date before merging
   ‚òë Do not allow bypassing the above settings
   ‚òê Allow force pushes (KEEP UNCHECKED)
   ‚òê Allow deletions (KEEP UNCHECKED)
   ```

4. **For `main` branch**: Ensure similar protections exist

---

## Step 4: Workflow Files

All workflow files have been created in `.github/workflows/`:
- ‚úÖ `test-orchestrator.yml` - Entry point
- ‚úÖ `claude-test-generator.yml` - Test generation
- ‚úÖ `test-review-enforcement.yml` - Safety rails
- ‚úÖ `ci.yml` - Modified to exclude test PRs from auto-merge

### Verify Workflows

1. Go to: **Actions** tab
2. You should see:
   - "Test Orchestrator - LLTC Generation Pipeline"
   - "Claude Test Generator - LLTC Creation"
   - "Test Review Enforcement - DO-178C Compliance"
   - "CI - Validation & Auto-Merge (Demo)"

---

## Step 5: Issue Templates

Issue template has been created at:
- ‚úÖ `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/test-request.yml`

### Verify Template

1. Go to: **Issues** ‚Üí **New Issue**
2. You should see: "üß™ Test Generation Request (LLTC)"
3. Click it to preview the form

---

## Step 6: Team Configuration

### Assign Reviewers

**Option A: Manual (Simple)**
- Team members manually review PRs with `ai-generated` label

**Option B: CODEOWNERS (Recommended)**

Create `.github/CODEOWNERS`:
```
# AI-generated tests must be reviewed by test team
/tests/ @your-org/test-engineers
```

**Option C: Automatic Assignment**

Modify `test-review-enforcement.yml` to add:
```yaml
- name: Request Reviews
  run: |
    gh pr edit ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} \
      --add-reviewer "@your-org/test-engineers"
```

---

## Step 7: Testing the Setup

### Test 1: Workflow Accessibility

```bash
# Check workflows are enabled
gh workflow list

# Expected output should include:
# - Test Orchestrator - LLTC Generation Pipeline
# - Claude Test Generator - LLTC Creation
# - Test Review Enforcement - DO-178C Compliance
```

### Test 2: Create Test Issue

1. Go to **Issues** ‚Üí **New Issue**
2. Select "üß™ Test Generation Request (LLTC)"
3. Fill out with sample data:
   ```
   File Path: src/lib/utils.ts
   Method Name: exampleFunction
   Code: export function exampleFunction(x: number) { return x * 2; }
   Priority: Medium
   ```
4. Submit issue
5. Wait for automation to trigger

### Test 3: Verify Jira Integration

Watch for:
- ‚úÖ Comment on issue with Jira ticket link
- ‚úÖ Jira ticket created in your project
- ‚úÖ Ticket has proper description and labels

### Test 4: Verify Test Generation

Watch for:
- ‚úÖ Branch created: `test-gen/[ticket]-[method]-[timestamp]`
- ‚úÖ Test file committed to branch
- ‚úÖ PR created to `to-be-reviewed-tests`
- ‚úÖ PR has review checklist comment

### Test 5: Verify Review Enforcement

Check the PR:
- ‚úÖ Has labels: `ai-generated`, `lltc`, `requires-review`
- ‚úÖ Auto-merge is disabled
- ‚úÖ Review checklist posted as comment
- ‚úÖ Tests ran successfully in CI

---

## Step 8: Documentation

Documentation has been created in `documentation/`:
- ‚úÖ `aviation-test-generation-workflow.md` - Full documentation
- ‚úÖ `test-workflow-quick-start.md` - Quick reference
- ‚úÖ `test-workflow-setup.md` - This file

### Share with Team

1. **Send links** to team members
2. **Schedule training** session (recommended)
3. **Do walkthrough** of first few test requests
4. **Collect feedback** and iterate

---

## Step 9: Customization

### Adjust for Your Organization

#### Jira Site URL

Update in workflow files:
```yaml
# In test-orchestrator.yml and claude-test-generator.yml
# Replace: https://your-domain.atlassian.net
# With: https://your-actual-site.atlassian.net
```

#### Test Framework

If not using Vitest, update prompts in `claude-test-generator.yml`:
```yaml
direct_prompt: |
  Use existing test framework (Jest/Mocha/Your Framework detected in project)
```

#### Review Requirements

Modify checklist in `test-review-enforcement.yml` to match your standards.

#### Coverage Targets

Adjust coverage thresholds based on your DO-178C level:
- Level A: MC/DC coverage required
- Level B: Decision coverage required
- Level C: Statement coverage required

---

## Step 10: Monitoring & Maintenance

### Monitor Workflows

**Dashboard**: Actions tab shows all workflow runs

**Key metrics to watch**:
- Success rate of test generation
- Average time from issue to PR
- Review time (PR creation to merge)
- Test quality (rework needed)

### Weekly Checks

```bash
# Check recent workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=test-orchestrator.yml --limit 10

# Check pending test PRs
gh pr list --label "ai-generated" --label "requires-review"

# Check failed workflows
gh run list --status failure --limit 5
```

### Monthly Reviews

- Review metrics and trends
- Collect feedback from test engineers
- Identify common issues in generated tests
- Update prompts to improve quality
- Share learnings with team

---

## Troubleshooting Setup

### Issue: Workflows Not Triggering

**Check**:
```bash
# Ensure workflows are enabled
gh workflow list

# Check specific workflow
gh workflow view test-orchestrator.yml
```

**Fix**: Enable workflows in repo settings

### Issue: MCP Connection Failed

**Check**:
- Atlassian credentials in `.env`
- Cloud ID is correct
- API token is valid
- User has permissions

**Fix**: Regenerate API token, verify credentials

### Issue: Jira Tickets Not Created

**Check**:
- Jira project exists
- User has create issue permission
- Issue type "Task" available
- Workflow logs for errors

**Fix**: Review Jira permissions, check project settings

### Issue: PR Not Created

**Check**:
- `to-be-reviewed-tests` branch exists
- User has push permissions
- Tests are passing
- Branch protections not too strict

**Fix**: Check workflow logs, verify permissions

### Issue: Review Checklist Not Posting

**Check**:
- Workflow has write permissions
- GitHub token valid
- PR was created successfully

**Fix**: Check workflow logs, verify permissions
