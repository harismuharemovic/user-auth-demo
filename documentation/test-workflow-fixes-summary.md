# Test Workflow Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Jira Ticket Creation Failing ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The Atlassian MCP server in the workflows wasn't receiving authentication credentials.

**Root Cause**: The `mcp_config` in both workflows was missing environment variable configuration for the MCP server.

**Solution**: Added environment variables to the MCP configuration in two places:

#### Test Orchestrator Workflow
```yaml
- name: Create Jira LLTC Ticket
  uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  env:
    # Pass credentials to the action
    ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL }}
    ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN }}
    ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_ID: ${{ secrets.ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_ID }}
  with:
    mcp_config: |
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "atlassian": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-atlassian"],
            "env": {
              # Pass credentials to the MCP server
              "ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL": "${{ secrets.ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL }}",
              "ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "${{ secrets.ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN }}",
              "ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_ID": "${{ secrets.ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_ID }}"
            }
          }
        }
      }
```

#### Test Generator Workflow
Applied the same fix to three MCP steps:
1. "Generate LLTC Test with Claude Code"
2. "Update Jira Ticket (Success)"
3. "Update Jira Ticket (Failure)"

**Required Setup**: You must configure these GitHub secrets:
- `ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL` - Your Atlassian account email
- `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN` - API token from https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
- `ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_ID` - Your site URL (e.g., `https://your-site.atlassian.net`)

See [`atlassian-mcp-setup.md`](./atlassian-mcp-setup.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Issue 2: Claude Not Creating PRs ✅ ALREADY WORKING

**Problem**: Claude generates tests but doesn't create PRs.

**Root Cause**: **This was not actually a problem!** The workflow was designed correctly but the behavior was misunderstood.

**How It Actually Works**:

1. **Tests Run First** (Line 220-239 of `claude-test-generator.yml`):
   ```yaml
   - name: Run Generated Tests
     id: test_execution
     continue-on-error: true
     run: |
       npm test -- --run --coverage 2>&1 | tee /tmp/test_output.txt
       TEST_EXIT_CODE=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
       
       if [ $TEST_EXIT_CODE -eq 0 ]; then
         echo "test_status=passed" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
       else
         echo "test_status=failed" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
       fi
   ```

2. **PR Created Only If Tests Pass** (Line 295-404):
   ```yaml
   - name: Create Pull Request (Tests Passed)
     if: steps.test_execution.outputs.test_status == 'passed' && steps.commit.outputs.has_changes == 'true'
     run: |
       gh pr create \
         --title "$PR_TITLE" \
         --body-file /tmp/pr_body.md \
         --base to-be-reviewed-tests \
         --head "${{ steps.branch.outputs.name }}" \
         --label "ai-generated"
   ```

3. **Failed Tests Don't Create PR** (Line 477-503):
   ```yaml
   - name: Comment on GitHub Issue (Test Failure)
     if: steps.test_execution.outputs.test_status == 'failed'
     run: |
       gh issue comment ${{ inputs.issue_number }} --body "### ❌ Test Generation Failed..."
   ```

**Conclusion**: The workflow already implements the desired behavior:
- ✅ Tests run before PR creation
- ✅ PRs only created when tests pass
- ✅ Failed tests are excluded (no PR created)
- ✅ Failing tests result in a comment on the issue with error details

---

### Issue 3: Tests Not Running Before PR Creation ✅ ALREADY WORKING

**Problem**: Need tests to run before PRs are made, with failing tests excluded.

**Root Cause**: This was already implemented! See Issue 2 above.

**Implementation Details**:

The workflow follows this sequence:
1. **Generate test file** → Claude creates comprehensive test
2. **Run tests** → Execute with `npm test -- --run --coverage`
3. **Check result** → Capture exit code and test status
4. **Branch on result**:
   - ✅ **Success path**: Commit → Push → Create PR → Update Jira → Comment on issue
   - ❌ **Failure path**: Comment on issue with errors → No commit, no push, no PR

**Safety Mechanism**:
```yaml
if: steps.test_execution.outputs.test_status == 'passed' && steps.commit.outputs.has_changes == 'true'
```

This ensures:
- Only passing tests get committed
- Only commits get pushed
- Only pushed branches get PRs
- Failed tests never reach the review stage

## Complete Workflow Architecture

### Phase 1: Test Request (test-orchestrator.yml)

**Trigger**: GitHub issue with `test-request` label or `@claude-test` mention

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Extract test request details from issue (file path, code snippet)
2. ✅ Validate format (file path + code snippet required)
3. ✅ **Create Jira LLTC ticket** via MCP (NOW FIXED with credentials)
4. ✅ Comment on GitHub issue with Jira link
5. ✅ Trigger test generation workflow
6. ✅ Label issue with `test-in-progress` and `ai-generated`

**Validation**: Invalid requests get commented with format requirements and labeled `invalid`.

---

### Phase 2: Test Generation (claude-test-generator.yml)

**Trigger**: Workflow dispatch from orchestrator with parameters

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Create test generation branch (`test-gen/{jira-key}-{method}-{timestamp}`)
2. ✅ Retrieve original issue details
3. ✅ **Generate comprehensive LLTC test** via Claude Code with MCP
   - Reads source file
   - Creates test file with DO-178C header
   - Includes traceability markers
   - Targets 100% coverage
4. ✅ **Run generated tests** with coverage
5. ✅ **Branch on test result**:

   **If Tests Pass** ✅:
   - Commit test file with proper message
   - Push branch to remote
   - **Create PR to `to-be-reviewed-tests` branch**
   - Update Jira ticket with success
   - Comment on GitHub issue with PR link
   
   **If Tests Fail** ❌:
   - Do NOT commit
   - Do NOT push
   - Do NOT create PR
   - Update Jira ticket with failure
   - Comment on GitHub issue with error details
   - Branch preserved for manual debugging

---

### Phase 3: Human Review (test-review-enforcement.yml)

**Trigger**: PR to `to-be-reviewed-tests` branch

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Post DO-178C review checklist (31 points)
2. ✅ Disable auto-merge
3. ✅ Re-run tests in CI environment
4. ✅ Require human approval

**Safety Rails**:
- Multiple mechanisms prevent auto-merge
- CI excludes `ai-generated` label from auto-merge
- Branch protection on `to-be-reviewed-tests` (if configured)
- Mandatory review checklist completion

---

### Phase 4: Integration

**After Human Approval**:
1. ✅ Merge to `to-be-reviewed-tests` branch
2. ✅ Test becomes part of reviewed test suite
3. ✅ Periodically batch merge to `main` with additional approval
4. ✅ Test becomes part of certification basis

---

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Test Execution Before PR (Implemented)
- Tests MUST pass before any PR is created
- Failed tests NEVER create PRs
- Branch preserved for debugging if tests fail

### 2. No Auto-Merge for AI Tests (Implemented)
- AI-generated tests labeled `ai-generated`
- Auto-merge job explicitly excludes these
- Review enforcement workflow disables auto-merge
- Multiple safety layers prevent accidental merge

### 3. Full Traceability (Implemented)
- GitHub issue → Jira ticket → Test file → PR
- Every test has header with references
- Audit trail preserved throughout
- DO-178C compliant documentation

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop (Implemented)
- Mandatory human review before merge
- 31-point DO-178C checklist
- Qualified engineer approval required
- Review must verify adequacy and accuracy

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED

```bash
gh secret set ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL --body "your-email@example.com"
gh secret set ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN --body "your-api-token"
gh secret set ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_ID --body "https://your-site.atlassian.net"
```

See [`atlassian-mcp-setup.md`](./atlassian-mcp-setup.md) for detailed instructions.

### 2. Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is Set

```bash
gh secret list | grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

### 3. Test the Workflow

Create a test issue:

```markdown
Title: Test Request: validateInput

File: src/lib/validation.ts

```typescript
export function validateInput(input: string) {
  if (!input) throw new Error('Invalid input');
  return input.trim();
}
```

Additional Context:
Test edge cases: empty string, null, whitespace
```

Add the `test-request` label and watch it work!

## Expected Behavior

### Successful Flow

1. **Issue created** with `test-request` label
2. **Orchestrator runs** → "✅ LLTC Test Generation Initiated"
3. **Jira ticket created** → Link posted in issue comment
4. **Tests generated** → Claude creates comprehensive test
5. **Tests run** → All pass ✅
6. **PR created** → Targets `to-be-reviewed-tests`
7. **Jira updated** → "Test generation complete"
8. **Review checklist posted** → 31-point DO-178C checklist
9. **Human reviews** → Approves or requests changes
10. **Merge to review branch** → Test integrated

### Failed Test Flow

1. **Issue created** with `test-request` label
2. **Orchestrator runs** → "✅ LLTC Test Generation Initiated"
3. **Jira ticket created** → Link posted in issue comment
4. **Tests generated** → Claude creates test
5. **Tests run** → Some fail ❌
6. **No PR created** → Branch preserved for debugging
7. **Jira updated** → "Test generation failed"
8. **Issue comment** → Error details and logs
9. **Manual intervention** → Review errors, retry or fix manually

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Successful Test Generation
- Choose a simple utility function
- Clear input/output behavior
- Few dependencies
- Should pass on first attempt

### Test 2: Complex Test Generation
- Function with multiple paths
- Edge cases and error handling
- Mock dependencies
- Tests AI's comprehensive coverage

### Test 3: Expected Failure
- Function with missing imports
- Unavailable test utilities
- Verify workflow handles gracefully
- Check error reporting is clear

---

## Troubleshooting

### Jira Ticket Not Created

**Check**:
1. Secrets are configured: `gh secret list`
2. API token is valid (not expired)
3. User has "Create Issues" permission in Jira project
4. Workflow logs show MCP server output

**Fix**: Follow [`atlassian-mcp-setup.md`](./atlassian-mcp-setup.md)

### Test Generation Fails

**Check**:
1. Source file exists at specified path
2. Method name is correct
3. Dependencies are in package.json
4. Test framework (Vitest) is installed

**Fix**: Review error output in issue comment

### PR Not Created

**Check**:
1. Did tests pass? (PR only created if tests pass)
2. Check workflow logs for test output
3. Verify `to-be-reviewed-tests` branch exists

**Expected**: If tests fail, no PR is created by design!
