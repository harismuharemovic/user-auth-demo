## 📋 What Was Built

### 1. Complete Test Generation Pipeline

```
User Pastes Code → Creates Issue
         ↓
   Orchestrator Creates Jira Ticket
         ↓
   Claude Generates Test (DO-178C Compliant)
         ↓
   Tests Execute Automatically
         ↓
   PR Created (Only if Tests Pass)
         ↓
   Human Reviews with Checklist
         ↓
   Approved & Merged
```

### 2. Four GitHub Actions Workflows

## 📊 Expected Performance

### Time Savings
- **Test Generation**: 5-10 minutes (vs. hours manually)
- **Coverage**: 100% automatically (vs. partial manual)
- **Review**: Structured checklist (vs. ad-hoc)

### Quality Improvements
- **Consistency**: All tests follow same structure
- **Completeness**: Edge cases automatically included
- **Traceability**: Built-in from the start

### Compliance Benefits
- **Audit Ready**: Complete evidence chain
- **Traceable**: Issue → Jira → PR → Commit
- **Repeatable**: Standardized process

## 🛡️ Safety & Compliance

### Multiple Safety Layers

1. ✅ **Branch Isolation**: Tests go to `to-be-reviewed-tests`, not `main`
2. ✅ **CI Exclusions**: Auto-merge skips all test PRs
3. ✅ **Label Checks**: Multiple label-based exclusions
4. ✅ **Review Enforcement**: Workflow disables auto-merge
5. ✅ **Human Approval**: Always required before merge

### DO-178C Compliance

| Requirement | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| Test-to-requirement traceability | ✅ Jira ticket + LLR references |
| Expected results defined | ✅ In test headers & assertions |
| Tests are repeatable | ✅ Independence verified |
| Test results documented | ✅ Automated reports |
| Tests are reviewed | ✅ Mandatory qualified review |
