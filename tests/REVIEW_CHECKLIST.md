# ‚úÖ AI-Generated Test Review Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist ensures AI-generated tests meet quality, security, and compliance standards before integration into the main test suite.

---

## Pre-Review Validation

Before human review, the system automatically validates:

- ‚úÖ Test executed successfully (passed all assertions)
- ‚úÖ No application code modifications (path guard passed)
- ‚úÖ File located in `tests/to-be-reviewed-tests/`
- ‚úÖ Audit log entry created
- ‚úÖ Jira ticket updated with results

---

## Human Review Checklist

### 1. Test Quality ‚≠ê

#### Structure & Organization
- [ ] Test file follows naming convention: `[TICKET-KEY].spec.ts` or `[method-name].spec.ts`
- [ ] Uses `describe` blocks for logical grouping
- [ ] Test names are descriptive: `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`
- [ ] Follows Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- [ ] No commented-out code

#### Coverage
- [ ] Tests happy path (normal valid inputs)
- [ ] Tests edge cases (boundaries, limits, extremes)
- [ ] Tests error cases (invalid inputs, exceptions)
- [ ] Tests null/undefined handling
- [ ] Tests type validation (if applicable)
- [ ] Coverage is comprehensive but not excessive

#### Assertions
- [ ] Assertions are specific (not just "exists" or "truthy")
- [ ] Error messages are tested (not just presence)
- [ ] Return values are validated
- [ ] Side effects are verified (if applicable)

**Rating:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (1-5 stars)

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Test is too broad (tests multiple things)

**Fix:** Split into multiple smaller tests
```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad
it('should validate and process input', () => { ... });

// ‚úÖ Good
it('should validate input format', () => { ... });
it('should process valid input', () => { ... });
```

### Issue: Magic numbers

**Fix:** Extract to named constants
```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad
expect(altitude).toBeLessThan(50000);

// ‚úÖ Good
const MAX_ALTITUDE_FEET = 50000;
expect(altitude).toBeLessThan(MAX_ALTITUDE_FEET);
```

### Issue: Unclear test name

**Fix:** Make it descriptive and specific
```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad
it('should work', () => { ... });

// ‚úÖ Good
it('should calculate great circle distance between two coordinates', () => { ... });
```

### Issue: Missing edge cases

**Fix:** Add tests for boundaries
```typescript
describe('when altitude is at boundaries', () => {
  it('should handle minimum altitude (0 feet)', () => { ... });
  it('should handle maximum altitude (50,000 feet)', () => { ... });
  it('should reject negative altitude', () => { ... });
  it('should reject altitude above maximum', () => { ... });
});
```

### Issue: Flaky test (timing-dependent)

**Fix:** Use proper waitFor/retry mechanisms
```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad
await page.click(button);
await page.waitForTimeout(1000); // Hardcoded wait

// ‚úÖ Good
await page.click(button);
await expect(page.locator('[role="alert"]')).toBeVisible();
```
