# Staging Directory for AI-Generated Tests

This directory temporarily holds AI-generated tests during validation.

## Purpose
- Tests are created here by Claude Code Agent
- Tests are executed for validation
- Successful tests are moved to `to-be-reviewed-tests/`
- Failed tests are deleted (logs preserved)

## Do Not Commit
This directory should remain empty in version control.
Test files here are transient and managed by automation.
